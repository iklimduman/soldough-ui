                    SolDough Market Mini-Collection is an item that we will be releasing to our community two weeks before SolDough collection! There will be 200 SolDough Market NFTs created and those NFTs will grant exclusive perks to its owners. People who own these NFTs will be entitled to free purchases from the SolDough collection (1 SolDough for 1 SolDough Market). In the future, we will also do surprise airdrops for our contributors who own the SolDough Market NFT.
                        <br></br>
                        SolDough Market NFT holders will also be natural members of the DAO. We plan to help set up when they verify their wallets. In addition to all this, it is a privilege for the whole SolDough family to have the first output of this project. Our intention is to create great excitement in the Solana network, creating a sweet experience. Stay tuned to witness this privilege.
